# cat_project - Learning Project


This is a **practice project** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It simulates a simple online shop where users can browse, sort, and select cats.  
All data is stored in **LocalStorage**, so the cart and wishlist are saved between sessions.

## Description

The project was created for educational purposes to practice front-end development skills:  
building UI components, implementing sorting/filtering logic, managing state with LocalStorage, and adding form validation with JavaScript.
